# LUNA: LUT-Based Neural Architecture for Fast and Low-Cost Qubit Readout


### Using the flow:
`logicnets\experiments\binary_classification` contains the code and instruction for setting up the differential evolution script and subsequent model training

`preprocessor` contains the adder tree templates

### The final designs
`quantum-net-final` contains final designs.
